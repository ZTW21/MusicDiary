# Music Diary
## What it does
Music Diary was created to provide a detailed review of a user's Spotify listening habits. This analysis of the user's Spotify account allows for the user to see their top tracks and top artists so that the user can get a feel for which genre and artist they prefer. Using the Spotify account API, Music Diary is able to securely load in the user's profile and help the user find what their true favorite music genre, artists, and tracks are. Users are able to see their Top tracks and artists on the home page. Then on the Diary page, users are able to create a diary entry of their favorite album, song, or artist and rank them accordingly. They can then add a picture of the song, album, or artist and then print the diary entry to keep as a record. Finally, on the artist's page, users are able to see a breakdown of their most listened to artists to get a better feel for their type of music.

## How we built it
This application was built using FastAPI and python. In order to pull the user data from Spotify, we then linked our website to the Spotify API and obtained the user's id. After setting up the backend, we then used HTML and CSS to build the front end side of the website and make it user friendly. We also used Adobe Photoshop to design the logo and icons on the web site.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge we faced during this event was the implementation and integration of the Spotify API into our website. Sending API requests turned out to be much harder than anticipated especially when the Spotify API was not meant to be used with Python for the backend. Unfortunately, because of time constraints, we were unable to resolve this issue and could not properly integrate the Spotify API into our website. We hope to continue working on this in the future so that we can implement this feature. The other issue we ran into was when deploying the website, we were able to successfully upload it to AWS but were unable to retrieve the callback link.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As a group, our biggest accomplishment was getting the Spotify API set up despite it being unable to integrate into our code. We were also new to the FastAPI program so we were proud to successfully set it up and build our website around it.

## What we learned
At the end of this experience, we learned that APIs are not as easy as we thought to set up. However, we learned being persistent is really important while programming. Our persistence and determination of bringing our idea to life helped us push through the initial setup of the Fast API and Spotify API which was quite difficult for us at the time.

## What's next for Music Diary
I can see us working on this app in the future and building it up with the potential we know it has. In the future, we plan to fully integrate the Spotify API into our website so that our website can directly pull user data. We also plan to add other unique features such as recently played tracks and albums and add a section where we can recommend music similar to the user's music taste.
